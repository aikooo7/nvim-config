My neovim dotfiles dev branch
==============

Disclaimer
--------------

This is my dev branch and it is where my code will be until it's stable.

That doesn't mean if you do a pull request that will not accept, it only means that I will only accept it if I fell like I need it.

**PULL REQUESTS WILL ONLY BE ACCEPTED TO THE DEV BRANCH.**


Enjoy it anyways.
